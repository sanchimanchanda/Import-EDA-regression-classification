# 📘 README: ML Assignment – Regression & Classification

## 🧪 Overview

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques on two datasets:

* **Diabetes Dataset**: Utilized for regression tasks.
* **Breast Cancer Dataset**: Applied in classification tasks.

The project encompasses data import, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model implementation, and evaluation.

## 📂 Dataset Details

* **Diabetes Dataset**: Available via `sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes`.
* **Breast Cancer Dataset**: Accessible through `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer`.

Both datasets are also provided as CSV files within the repository for convenience.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab:

   * [Open Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12USZCV4XF85Fx-JaXKatf771l_z4QCZs?usp=sharing)
2. Ensure all necessary libraries are installed by running the installation commands provided in the first code cell.
3. Execute each cell sequentially to perform the tasks outlined in the notebook.

## 🔍 Project Structure

### 1. Import, Load, and View Dataset

* Import required libraries.
* Load datasets using `load_diabetes` and `load_breast_cancer`.
* Display the first few rows to understand the structure.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Generate descriptive statistics.
* Visualize data distributions and relationships using plots.

### 3. Regression Analysis (Diabetes Dataset)

* Implement Linear Regression using `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`.
* Evaluate model performance using R² and MSE metrics.

### 4. Classification Analysis (Breast Cancer Dataset)

* **Bayesian Logistic Regression**:

  * Apply Laplace approximation for posterior estimation.
  * Compute credible intervals for coefficients.
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:

  * Utilize `sklearn.svm.SVC` with RBF kernel.
  * Assess model accuracy and AUC.

## 📊 Visualizations

The notebook includes various plots to aid in data understanding and model evaluation:

* Histograms and pair plots for feature distributions.
* ROC curves and confusion matrices for classification performance.

## 📈 Results Summary

* **Linear Regression (Diabetes)**:

  * R² (test): 0.4526
  * MSE (test): 2900.19
* **Bayesian Logistic Regression (Breast Cancer)**:

  * Posterior summaries with credible intervals for coefficients.
* **SVM Classification (Breast Cancer)**:

  * Accuracy: 98.25%
  * AUC: 0.9974
